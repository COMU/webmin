<header>Relocated Mapping</header>


The optional relocated file provides the information that is used in &quot;user
has moved to new_location&quot; bounce messages.

<p>

Table lookups are case insensitive.

The &quot;Maps to...&quot; field specifies contact information such as an email
address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number. It's one of the
following:
<ul>
<li><tt>user@domain</tt>: Matches <tt>user@domain</tt> . This form has precedence over
all other forms.

<li><tt>user</tt>: Matches <tt>user@site</tt> when site is <tt>$myorigin</tt>,
when site is listed in <tt>$mydestination</tt>, or when site is listed in
<tt>$inet_interfaces</tt> .

<li><tt>@domain</tt>: Matches every address in domain. This form has the lowest
precedence.
</ul>

ADDRESS EXTENSION: When the search fails, and the address localpart contains
the optional recipient delimiter (e.g., <tt>user+foo@domain</tt>), the search
is repeated for the unextended address (e.g. <tt>user@domain</tt>).
