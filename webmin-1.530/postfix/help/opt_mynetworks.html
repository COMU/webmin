This parameter specifies the list of networks that are local to this machine.
The list is used by the anti-UCE software to distinguish local clients from
strangers. See <tt>permit_mynetworks</tt> and
<a href=opt_smtpd_recipient_restrictions><tt>smtpd_recipient_restrictions</tt></a>
in the SMTP configuration.

<p>

The default is a list of all networks attached to the machine: a complete class
A network (X.0.0.0/8), a complete class B network (X.X.0.0/16), and so on. If
you want stricter control, specify a list of network/mask patterns, where the
mask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host address. You
can also specify the absolute pathname of a pattern file instead of listing the
patterns here.
