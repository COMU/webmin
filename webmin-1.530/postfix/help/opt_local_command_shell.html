<header>Shell to use for delivery to external command</header>

<center><tt>local_command_shell</tt></center>
<hr>

This parameter controls what shell will be used for delivery to external
command. By default, external commands are executed directly; commands are
given to <tt>/bin/sh</tt> only when they contain shell meta characters or
shell built-in commands.

<p>

Specify a different shell when you need more control over what
programs can be run from e.g. <tt>.forward</tt> files. 

<p>

&quot;sendmail's restricted shell&quot; <tt>smrsh</tt> is what most people will
use (<tt>smrsh</tt> is part of recent sendmail distributions)

<p>

Note: when a shell is specified, it is invoked even when the
command contains no shell built-in commands or meta characters.

<p>

Example: <tt>/some/where/smrsh -c</tt>
