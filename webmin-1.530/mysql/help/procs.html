<header>Database Connections</header>

This page displays all current connections to the MySQL database server,
except for the one used to actually request the connection list. You can
terminate a connection (and the query it is running) by selecting it and 
clicking the <b>Kill Selected Connections</b> button. <p>

In some cases, a connection and its associated query may continue to run even
when the client has exited. It will still appear on this page though. <p>
