<header>Table Permissions</header>

The page allows you to grant additional access to tables by users, beyond
what is available in <tt>User Permissions</tt> or <tt>Database Permissions</tt>.
The permissions granted here apply only to access to one table in one database
by one user, thus allowing quite fine-grained access to be granted. <p>

To add new table permissions, you must first select the database that the
table is in using the form at the bottom of the page. Then click the
<tt>Add new permissions</tt> button to bring up a form for selecting the
table and other details. <p>
