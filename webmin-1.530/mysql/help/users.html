<header>User Permissions</header>

This page allows you to create and edit users who will have access
to your MySQL databases. For each user, you can specify a username, password,
allowable hosts and a set of permissions that determine what the user can
do. <p>

Because any user listed who has permissions will have those permissions on
<b>all</b> databases, it is usually a good idea not to grant users on this
page any permissions. Instead, use the <tt>Database Permissions</tt>
page to grant access to users on a per-database basis. <p>
