<header>Network Interface</header>

A zone's network interface is a virtual IP interface in the global system that
is assigned as the primary interface for this zone. Each has an IP address
which must be unique, an associated real network interface, and an optional netmask. As some as an interface is created on this page, it will be activated in the zone (assuming the zone is running). <p>
