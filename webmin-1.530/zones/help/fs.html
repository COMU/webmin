<header>Additional Filesystem</header>

This page allows you to mount a drive or partition from the global system into a directory within a zone. This can be useful if a zone needs to store large amounts of data and you want to isolate this from the disks used by other zones and the global system. <p>

For most filesystem type, you can select a mount directory, the source partition or device, and options for the mount. For some types that are not supported by Webmin the source device and options must be entered manually. <p>

This page cannot be used to create NFS mounts - instead, they can be created by simply using normal mount commands within the zone itself. <p>
