<header>Execution Profiles</header>

An execution profile defines a command associated with an existing profile
that is executed with different Unix user and group rights from the user who
actually runs it. They allow functionality similar to setuid programs, but
with different behaviour depending on the user. <p>

Each execution profile has an associated profile, a command that it applies to,
and a set of user and group rights that the command is run with. These
additional rights will only be used if the command is run from a profile-aware
shell, such as <tt>pfcsh</tt> or <tt>pfsh</tt>. <p>

If you have created your own profiles, you can use this page to add commands
to run to them. However, execution profiles that are included as standard
with the operating system should not be modified unless you know what you
are doing. <p>
