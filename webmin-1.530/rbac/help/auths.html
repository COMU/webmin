<header>Authorizations </header>

An authorization is  a  right  assigned  to  users and profiles  that  is
checked  by certain privileged programs to determine whether
users can execute restricted functionality. Each has a short code name
and a human readable description. <p>

Typically, you will not need to add to or change any of the authorizations
on this page unless you are developing your own software that makes use of
RBAC to determine what users are allowed to do. <p>
