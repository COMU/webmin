---- Changes since 1.380 ----
First version of this module, for configuring the OpenLDAP server and managing its database.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----
Added an option to create an example LDAP group, and made the example user a person.
---- Changes since 1.440 ----
The protocols served by the LDAP server, such as SSL and non-encrypted, can now be set on the OpenLDAP Server Configuration page. This is only possible on Redhat and Debian-derived systems though, as the protocols are configured in the init script.
Fixed a bug that prevented browsing of the LDAP database in SSL mode, thanks to Paul R. Ganci.
---- Changes since 1.470 ----
Updated the module to support the new OpenLDAP LDIF-format configuration files, as seen on Ubuntu 8.10.
---- Changes since 1.510 ----
Fixed numerous bugs in editing the new LDIF-format access control rules.
