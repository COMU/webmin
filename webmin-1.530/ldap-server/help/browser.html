<header>Browse Database</header>

This page allows you to navigate through the heirarchy of objects in your
LDAP database, create and remove objects, and edit their attributes.
The DN for the object being managed is always shown in the <b>Browsing</b>
field - to quickly navigate to another object, enter a new DN and click <b>
Show</b>. To move up the heirarchy, click on <b>Browse Parent</b>. <p>

The rest of the page is divided into two tabs :
<dl>
<dt><b>Child objects</b>
<dd>This table lists all objects under the current one. You can edit a
    sub-object by clicking on it's DN, or delete objects by checking them and
    hitting the <b>Remove Selected Children</b> button. To change the DN of
    a sub-object, click on the <b>Rename</b> link and enter a new DN in the
    field that appears. <p>
    Clicking on <b>Add a new sub-object</b> will bring up a form for entering
    the details of a new empty object under the current one. <p>

<dt><b>Object attributes</b>
<dd>This table lists all attributes of the current object. To edit the values
    of one, click on the <b>Edit</b> link on the right. To delete attributes,
    check the boxes next to them and then click the <b>Remove Selected
    Attributes</b> button. In both cases, the LDAP server will enforce 
    restrictions on allowed and required attributes for the object's class. <p>
    A new attribute can be created by clicking the <b>Add attribute to
    object</b> link, which will display field for entering a name and value.
