<header>Miscellaneous Options</header>

This page contains options that don't really fit in any other category.
Most useful is the table in the second section that allows you to set
the nice level (process priority) for FTP sessions by class. A negative
nice level gives the session a higher CPU priority, while a positive
nice level gives a lower priority. On most operating systems, the allowable
nice levels range from -20 to 20. <p>

The bottom table sets the file permissions mask for new files and directories
by class. For example, a umask of <tt>0700</tt> would give newly uploaded
files permissions of 077 (<tt>---rw-rw-</tt>). <p>
