<header>Permissions</header>

The first table on this page controls can be used to deny access to certain
non-vital commands. For each command, you can choose whether to allow or
deny access and choose which user types and classes it should be allowed or
denied to. Unless denied, all commands are available to all users by
default. <p>

The second table allow you to prevent the upload of files that contain
certain characters or matching certain regular expressions. This can be
very useful if your anonymous FTP server has an <tt>incoming</tt> directory
and you want to prevent users creating 'hidden' directories to store warez
in. The first field in the table is a regexp like <tt>^[A-z0-9]$</tt> that
defines allowable characters, the second is a series of regexps for filenames
that are <b>not</b> allowed, the third is the user types that this restriction
applies to, and the final column the full path to an error message file
to be sent to the FTP client if an illegal file is uploaded. <p>
