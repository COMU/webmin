<header>Anonymous FTP</header>

The first table on this page allows you to specify the directory that
the server will switch to with <tt>chroot</tt> when an anonymous FTP
user logs in. A different directory can be chosen for different user
classes, or the one directory can be used for all classes. If no directory
is specified, the FTP server will <tt>chroot</tt> to the home directory
of the <tt>ftp</tt> user. <p>

Because the server calls external programs like <tt>ls</tt> and <tt>tar</tt>,
the anonymous root directory must contain a <tt>bin</tt> directory with
those programs, a <tt>lib</tt> directory containing any shared libraries
needed, an an <tt>etc</tt> directory containing <tt>passwd</tt> and
<tt>group</tt> files. When the server uses <tt>chroot</tt> to limit
access to the anonymous root directory, it cannot access any programs
outside that directory. <p>

The second table controls which directory the server will <tt>chroot</tt>
to for guest users. For each directory, you can specify which users this
directory will apply to by entering usernames, UIDs (like <tt>%3000</tt>)
or UID ranges (like <tt>%3000-3006</tt>). If no users are entered, the
directory is used for all guest users. <p>

The third table allows you to control which Unix group anonymous FTP
users will be switched to, instead of the primary group for the <tt>ftp</tt>
user. For each group entered you can choose one or more user classes,
for example to grant access to certain files to anonymous users from
certain IP addresses. <p>

Finally, the bottom section of the page has inputs to control what
passwords are acceptable for anonymous FTP logins. Traditionally, FTP
users should send a valid email address as their anonymous login password. <p>
