<header>Limits and Access Control</header>

This page contains several tables for setting limits and access control
options. The first table allows you to specify client IP address to be denied
access to the FTP server, an an error message file to display to the denied
client. Addresses may be given as full or partial
IP addresses, IP networks/netmasks, hostnames, host wildcards
(like <tt>*.foo.com</tt>) or the absolute paths to files containing additional
addresses. Any type of address can be preceded with a ! to negate it. <p>

The second table allows you to limit the number of concurrent logins by
clients of each class. For each class you can enter the maximum simultaneous
logins, the days and times at which the maximum is enforced (in UUCP style,
like <tt>MoTuTh0800-1700</tt>), and an error message file to display to
clients when the limit is reached. <p>

The third table allows you to set per-session file and data transfer limits.
For each limit, you must choose whether it applied to files or bytes
transferred, the transfer direction the limit applies to, whether the limit
applies to just file transfers or all data, and the class of users the
limit is for. <p>

The fourth table allows you to deny access to certain files. For each file
you need to enter an absolute path, choose whether the path is relative
to the <tt>chroot</tt> directory (for anonymous and guest users) and select
the user classes this restriction applies to. If a file to deny ends with
a /, the FTP server will deny access to all files in that directory. <br>
Similarly, the fifth table allows you to grant access to files that would
be otherwise denied by the table above. <p>
