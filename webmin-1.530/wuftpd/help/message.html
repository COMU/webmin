<header>Messages and Banners</header>

The first table on this page allows you to configure message files to be
displayed to the user at login time or when a certain directory is entered.
For each message file you must specify a path (absolute or relative to the
directory), choose when it is to be displayed, and select the user classes
to display this message file for (if no classes are entered, the file will be
displayed for all). <p>

The second table is for configuring README files. The FTP server will display
the last modification time of each file, either at login or when a certain
directory is entered. For each README file you must specify a path, choose
when it is to be displayed, and select the user classes to display the
last modification time for. <p>

At the bottom of the page are a few additional options that relate to
message files. Most useful is the <tt>Pre-login banner</tt> option, which
allows you to choose a file to be displayed before the user logs in. <p>
