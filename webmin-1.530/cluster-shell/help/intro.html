<header>Cluster Shell Commands</header>

This module is similar to <b>Command Shell</b>, but allows simple commands to
be run on multiple servers concurrently instead of just on this server. On the
main page you can enter a command to run (or select an old one), and choose
one or more servers or groups to execute it on. Only servers that have been
created in the <b>Webmin Servers Index</b> module with a login and password
will appear in the list. <p>
