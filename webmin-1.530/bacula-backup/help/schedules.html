<header>Backup Schedules</header>

This page lists schedules that can be applied to backup jobs, in order to have
them automatically executed by Bacula on a regular basis. Each schedule has
a unique name, and a list of backup levels and run times. Each run time must
be formatted like <i>mon-fri at 9:00</i> or <i>sat at 23:00</i>, indicating the
days of the week and time to execute. Days can also be specified as days 
of the month, like <i>1st sun</i> or <i>on 5</i>. See the Bacula online
documentation for the full details of allowed formats. <p>
