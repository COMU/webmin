<header>Volume Pools</header>

In the Bacula context, a pool is a set of volumes that are dedicated to some
purpose. A volume is typically a specific tape or destination directory, each
of which is labelled with a unique name. When creating a backup job you can
select which pool will be used for destination files, and thus which volumes.

A volume can be added to a pool using the <b>Label Volume</b> page, which
marks an inserted tape or destination directory with a unique name. <p>
