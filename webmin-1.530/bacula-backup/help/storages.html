<header>Storage Daemons</header>

Each entry on this page defines a connection to a particular device on a 
Bacula storage daemon. Typically the daemon runs on the same system, but it
is possible to define more than one daemon, some of which are on remote hosts
with different tape drive types or more disk space. <p>

The important attributes for each daemon are :<br>
<dl>
<dt>Storage name
<dd>A unique name used on this system to identify the daemon.
<dt>Bacula SD password
<dd>This field must contain the password used by the storage daemon on the remote system, which can be found in the <tt>/etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf</tt> file.
<dt>Hostname or IP address
<dd>The fully qualified hostname or IP of the system running the storage daemon.
<dt>Storage device name
<dd>Each storage daemon can define one or more devices, each of which corresponds to a different directory or tape drive. This field determines which device this particular daemon connection uses.
<dt>Media type name
<dd>This field must contain a short name for the type of media used by the storage device, such as <i>File</i> or <i>DDS-2</i>. It must be the same as the media type in the <b>Storage Devices</b> section on the storage server.
</dl>

Often it is useful to have more than one entry for the same host on this page,
each of which has a different storage device. This allows you to create backups
that write to different directories or tape drives. <p>

If the TLS options are shown on the storage daemon form, they can be used
to enable secure communication between the director and the remote storage
server. This is typically not necessary in a simple Bacula configuration, as
the storage and director daemons usually run on the same system. <p>
