<header>Bacula Group Backup Jobs</header>

This page lists backup jobs that are set up to run on all hosts in a Bacula
group at once. They have the same settings as standard backup jobs, except
that you cannot define default jobs to share settings between jobs. Also,
instead of selecting a client to backup, you must instead select a previously
defined Bacula group. <p>
