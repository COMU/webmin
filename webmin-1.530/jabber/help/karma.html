<header>Karma Traffic Control</header>

The Jabber server has the ability to restrict the amount of bandwidth a
client can use, which can be setup using the options on this page :

<ul>
<li><b>Excessive connection handling</b><br>
    If this is enabled, the server will only allow a client to make at most a
    chosen number of requests within a chosen time period. <p>

<li><b>Karma mode</b><br>
    For this option, you can choose for the server not to enforce any
    per-client traffic limits, choose one of the three pre-defined limit
    settings (low, medium or high), or enter your own selected limits.
    This final option should only be used if you are familiar with the
    meanings of all the fields. <p>
</ul>
