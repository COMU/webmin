<header>IP Access Control</header>

On this page you can control which IP addresses are allowed to access
your Jabber server. If any addresses are entered into the <b>Allowed client
IPs</b> section, then only those addresses will be granted access - otherwise
any address will be allowed to connect. However, any address listed in
the <b>Denied client IPs</b> section will be blocked, whether it is on
the allowed list or not. <p>

Both fields accept IP addresses (like 1.2.3.4) or IP/netmask pairs
(like 1.2.3.0/255.255.255.0) for specifying an entire network. <p>
