<header>Administrative Users</header>

On this page you can choose which Jabber users will receive admin messages
sent to the server. The <b>Autoreply</b> section of the page allows you
to configure a message that will be sent back in response to any admin
message, which is typically used to tell the sender that their message has
been forwarded to an appropriate administrator. <p>
