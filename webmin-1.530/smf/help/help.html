<h3>Introduction</h3>
This module allows you to view/modify/update/add SMF services in Solaris
10. The main page consists of a listing of services, and you can select a 
specific category, view disabled serivces, sort entries etc. From here you
can also launch a wizard-type utility that manages service creation, view
the service state, dependencies/dependent, and view property groups/properties
for each service. </p>

<h3>Main Window</h3>
By default, main SMF module window lists the enabled services on the system,
showing their states, the FMRI that identifies the service, and the description
that is supplied with the service. You can apply state changes to multiple
services by checking the desired serivces, and clicking enable/disable etc.
You can also delete the service instances specified, but obviously avoid doing
this for important services. <p>

<h3>Instance Viewer Window</h3>
Clicking on the FMRI of a particular instance in the main window brings up the
instance viewer, which displays instance name/description, state, any associated
manual pages (which can be clicked and viewed), explanations for
unusual states (which can be clicked and viewed), references to associated
logfiles (which again can be clicked and viewed). From here it is
also possible to view the dependency/dependent trees for the instance
by clicking the appropriate link, and view/edit property groups/properties
by also clicking the appropriate link.

<h3>Property Group/Property Editor Windows</h3>
Clicking on the View/Edit Property Groups/Properties link in the instance viewer
brings up the property group editor, displaying the property groups associated
with the selected FMRI. You can add/delete/modify property groups here,
and do the same to the associated properties by clicking the relevant property
group in the property group editor. <p>

<h3>Dependency/Dependent Viewer Window</h3>
Clicking on the View Dependency/Dependent Tree link in the instance viewer
brings up the dependency/dependent tree for that instance. By default, the view
shows first-level dependencies/dependents, but by clicking the + button,
you can expand the tree to see what depends on the services that depend
on the service etc. Similarly to the main window, state changes can be
applied to multiple services, using checkboxes to identify the services
you want to change. Clicking on an instance FMRI brings up the dependency/
dependent trees for that instance. <p>

<h3>Service Creation Wizard</h3>
Clicking the "Create New Serivce" button brings up the SMF service creation
wizard, which collects the required information to create a new SMF service,
formats it into a manifest and imports it into the SMF repository. Successful
import will result in the service appearing in the main services listing.<p>

<h3>Service Instance Search Form</h3>
A rudimentary FMRI search is supplied, whereby entering
a part of service FMRI is sufficient to find all matching FMRIs, e.g.
"nfs" retrieves all services with "nfs" in FMRI. A "browse" facility is also
supplied. <p>
