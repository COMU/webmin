<h3>Service Listing</h3>
The listing displayed on this page is the result of running
the svcs command using wildcard matching to display the required service 
category, e.g. svcs network/*. Different categories (including all services)
can be selected by selecting the category from the dropdown menu, and
clicking "Update View". By default, only enabled services are shown,
but this can be changed by checking the "Include Disabled Services" box
and again clicking "Update View". Extra fields can be added to the view
also (NextState and StartTime). <p>

State changes/deletions can be applied to the services checked in the main
window listing. Sorting can be carried out by any of the columns, and
by default, services are sorted such that the "unusual" states appear
at the top of the listing. <p>

By clicking the FMRI field for a service, we can examine all associated
details, from the basic (on the main instance viewer page) such as
name/description, to all the properties. <p>
 
Clicking the "Create New Serivce" button brings up the SMF service creation
wizard, which collects the required information to create a new SMF service,
formats it into a manifest and imports it into the SMF repository. Successful
import will result in the service appearing in the main services listing.<p>

Clicking the "Search for Services" button brings up a search form. Entering
a part of service FMRI is sufficient to find all matching FMRIs, e.g.
"nfs" retrieves all nfs services. A "browse" facility is also supplied. <p>
