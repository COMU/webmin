<h3>Dependency/Dependent Tree Viewer</h3>
The information displayed on this page corresponds to dependency/dependent tree
information, as gathered by svcs -d/-D, i.e. what services depend on this
service, and what services does it depend on? State changes can be applied to
dependents/dependencies, and clicking a dependent/dependency fmri brings you to
its state editor page. <p>

The dependency/dependent trees can be expanded/collapsed to any desired
level by clicking the "+" and "-" buttons respectively. State changes
can be applied to the service and selected dependencies/dependents using
checkboxes to select the services.<p>

Clicking on a FMRI in the dependency/dependent tree will bring you to the
dependency/dependent tree for that instance. <p>
