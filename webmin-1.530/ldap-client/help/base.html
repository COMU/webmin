<header>LDAP Search Bases</header>

An LDAP server's databsae is organized heirarchially, typically with
different branches in the tree for users, groups and other services. This
page allows you to select where in the LDAP database to search for
different types of information, and how deep to search for each. <p>

By default, all searches will be done under the <b>Global search base</b>.
However, because most servers put users and groups under different sub-trees,
you will probably need to set the <b>Base for Unix users</b> and
<b>Base for Unix groups</b> to the distinguished names for those sub-trees.
The <b>Base for Unix passwords</b> should be set to the same DN as
<b>Base for Unix users</b>, as password information is almost always
stored with other user attributes. <p>
