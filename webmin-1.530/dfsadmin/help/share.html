Each share has a directory that is being exported, a description for
NFS clients, three list of hosts with different levels of access to
that share and a number of other options. <p>

A share can be exported read-only or read-write to a list of clients.
By default, the <tt>root</tt> user on client systems is not trusted by the
server, unless the client is on the root access list as well. <p>
