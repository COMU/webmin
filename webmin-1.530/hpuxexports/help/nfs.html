<h3>Introduction to NFS</h3>

NFS is the standard file-sharing protocol used by Unix systems. NFS allows
one system to export a directory across the network to one or more other
hosts, allowing users and programs on those hosts to access exported files
as though they were local. <p>

An NFS server is a system which exports one or more directories, while an NFS
client is a system that mounts one or more directories from a server. A
host can be both an NFS server and a client of other servers. <p>

A server controls which clients can mount an exported directory by checking
the IP address of the client against a list of allowed hosts for the
requested directory. The server can also designate an export read-only,
or read-only for certain clients. <p>

Unlike other network filesystems, an NFS client does not have to login to
the server when mounting an exported directory. The server trusts the client
to authenticate users and provide the ID of the current user when accessing
exported files.  Thus you should only allow client hosts that you trust to
mount exported directories. <p>
