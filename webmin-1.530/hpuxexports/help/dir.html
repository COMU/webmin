<header>Directory to export</header>

This is the directory being exported to the clients listed in the
<a href=client>Export to..</a> section. Unlike other NFS servers, Linux
supports the re-exporting of a directory that has been NFS mounted from
another host, and the exporting of a directory that contains mount points
for other filesystems.
