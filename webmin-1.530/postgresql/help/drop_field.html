<header>Drop Field</header>

On this page you can delete an existing table field. 
Click the radio button after the field to indicate which field to delete.
Also confirm in the checkbox that you want to perform the deletion and
that you understand that all the data in that column will be lost.
Note that all definitions (such as a definition of a default value)
in the table are lost other than column names, types, and sizes.
Click on the button to drop the field.  <p>
