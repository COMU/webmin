<header>Webmin PostgreSQL Backup Form Help</header>

<p />
    The PostgreSQL system user id must have write permission on any 
directory used as a target for any backup.

<p />
    Regardless of the backup file format selected, each database 
will be backed up into a single file having the form:
&lt;name&gt;.&lt;extension&gt; where &lt;extension&gt; will be one 
of 'post', 'tar', or 'sql'.

<p />
   Commands specified to run before and after backup are triggered 
before and after <em><strong>each</strong></em> database and 
<strong>NOT</strong> just once before and once after the entire set.
