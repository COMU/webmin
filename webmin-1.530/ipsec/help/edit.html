<header>Edit or Create Connection</header>

This page allowes you to create a new IPsec connection, or edit the
details of an existing one. A connection with the same settings must be
created on the systems at both ends of the VPN tunnel that you want to create.
<p>

Fields in the <b>IPsec VPN connection details</b> section that must be provided
for each connection and their recommended settings are listed below :
<dl>
<dt><b>Connection name</b>
<dd>A short name for this connection with no spaces.
<dt><b>At IPsec startup</b>
<dd>If <b>Add connection</b> is chosen, this connection will only be established
    when explicity started. If <b>Start connection</b> is chosen then it will
    be launched as soon as the IPsec server is started. The former option is
    best for tunnels to remote systems that are only periodically active, while
    the latter is suitable for permanent VPN links.
<dt><b>Compress data?</b>
<dd>Should be left set to <b>Default</b>.
<dt><b>Connection type</b>
<dd>Should also be left set to <b>Default</b>.
</dl>

Addtional information must be supplied for the systems on either end of the
connection. This must be the same on both systems, although generally the
<b>Local</b> and <b>Remote</b> details are swapped so that the settings for
this host are always in the <b>Local or left system's settings</b> section.
The fields in each section and their suggested settings are :
<dl>
<dt><b>Public IP address</b>
<dd>This field should be set to the fixed IP address of the system, or 
    <b>Automatic</b> for a host whose IP is dynamically assigned. Both the local
    and remote sections cannot have this field set to <b>Automatic</b> at the
    same time though.
<dt><b>System identifier</b>
<dd>The <b>Hostname</b> option should be selected and the system's hostname
    entered into the text field. FreeSWAN uses this setting to determine which
    section of the connection applied to which host.
<dt><b>Private subnet behind system</b>
<dd>If this system has an internal network connected to it that the other
    host should be granted access to, enter a network address and prefix length
    (like <i>192.168.1.0/24</i>) into this field.
<dt><b>System's public key</b>
<dd>You should generally select <b>Entered below</b> and enter the system's
    RSA public key into the text box. This can be seen on the <b>Show Public
    Key</b> page on that system.
<dt><b>Next hop to other system</b>
<dd>Unless you have an unusual network setup, this field should be set to
    <b>Default route</b>.
</dl>

After creating or editing a connection, the <b>Apply Configuration</b> button
on the module's main page must be used to activate the changes. <p>
