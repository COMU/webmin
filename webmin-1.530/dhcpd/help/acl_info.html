<header>DHCPd ACL subsystem</header>

<h3>TARGETS:</h3>
The main goal of the ACL subsystem is providing a powerfull, flexible and
extendable access control mechanism for different objects in the DHCPd
configuration. These objects are shared networks, subnets, groups of hosts
and hosts. <p>

Also the ACL subsystem allows you to control some other features, such as:
unique object names, applying of changed configuration, viewing and deletion
of DHCP leases. <p>

<h3>CONCEPTS:</h3>
We can show the DHCPd configuration file as a tree structure. Each node of
this tree represents configuration of a different DHCP object (fig. 0). <p>

The ACL subsystem supports two permission levels:
<ul>
<li>global: read, write, create;</li>
<li>per-object: read, write.</li>
</ul>

Global permissions exist for each type of object (hosts, groups, subnets,
shared networks) and control operations with a whole object set of given
type:
<ul type=circle>
<li>Global create</li>
<li>Global read</li>
<li>Global write</li>
</ul>

Per-object permissions give you a more flexible way of access control.
Per-object permissions ACL exist for every individual object. Today
per-object ACLs are impemented only for hosts and subnets:
<ul type=circle>
<li>Per-object read</li>
<li>Per-object write</li>
</ul>

The ACL subsystem can operate in four different security levels (or modes).
