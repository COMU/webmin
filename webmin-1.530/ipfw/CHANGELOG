---- Changes since 1.140 ----
First version of this module, which can manage a BSD IPFW firewall. Allows the creation, and editing of rules, and supports all actions and the most common conditions and options. Thanks to Olav Berge for sponsoring this module.
---- Changes since 1.180 ----
Added button for deleting multiple rules from list.
---- Changes since 1.200 ----
The firewall configuration can now be copied automatically to multiple hosts in a cluster, and will be applied on all hosts when the the Apply button is clicked. Like other cluster features in Webmin, this requires that the servers be first setup in the Webmin Servers Index module.
---- Changes since 1.260 ----
When creating a firewall rule, the rule number can be optionally manually entered.
---- Changes since 1.380 ----
On FreeBSD systems, the firewall is now enabled at boot using /etc/rc.conf, and the IPFW config file specified in rc.conf is now used automatically.
---- Changes since 1.510 ----
Added support for the firewall_script directive in /etc/rc.conf, as seen on FreeBSD 8.
