<header>Webmin CFengine Cluster</header>

This page allows you to easily run CFengine on multiple hosts, using a single
master configuration. It is an alternative to using the Configuration Engine
Daemon and Remote Configuration Hosts pages elsewhere in this module, but like
other cluster Webmin modules it requires that Webmin be installed on each of
the hosts to be managed, and that each be defined in the Webmin Servers
module. <p>

The top part of the page displays hosts on which CFengine is installed and can
be run from this page. To add a new host, first add it in the Webmin Servers
with a username and password, select it from the list next to the Add Server
button and then click the button. The server must have the CFengine module
installed and configured properly. <p>

At the bottom of the page is a form for running CFengine on all listed hosts
simultaneously. If you click the lower button the configuration from this host will
be copied to each of the other hosts, overwriting any existing CFengine
configuration file. This allows you to maintain one master configuration on this
server and have it distributed when needed. Hostname classes can be used to
have different actions executed on different servers if needed. <p>
