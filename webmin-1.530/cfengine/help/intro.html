<header>Configuration Engine</header>

CFengine is a powerful tool that allows you to define a series of
system administration actions to be carried out when necessary, in order
to perform tasks like creating links and directories, setting file permisions
managing running processes and tidying up old files. Its class system
allows you to use the same configuration on multiple systems, with different
actions being carried out depending on the system type, hostname or other
criteria. <p>

The main page of this module lists all the actions setup on your system,
the classes that they apply to, and a summary of what the action will do
for each class. You can add a new action type by using the button below
the table, add a new class for an existing action by clicking on the
<i>Add class..</i> link, or edit an existing class for an action by
clicking on the class name in the <i>Apply to classes</i> column. <p>

If your configuration is currently empty, you should start by creating
a <i>Master control</i> action that determines which other actions get run. When
adding new actions, you must also make sure that they are listed in the
master control action. If not, <i>No</i> will appear next to the action
in the <i>Active?</i> column, and it will never be run. <p>
