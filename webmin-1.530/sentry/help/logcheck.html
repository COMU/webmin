<header>Logcheck Configuration</header>

Logcheck is a program that automatically monitors your system logfiles on
a regular basis and emails security violations to you. It looks for messages
generated by various programs (including Portsentry and Hostsentry) that
indicate a hacking attempt, and generates a report which is emailed to
the chosen address. <p>

The options on this page are :
<ul>
<li><b>Email reports to</b><br>
    The email address to which security violation reports and sent. <p>

<li><b>Hacking log messages</b><br>
    A list of messages which if found in one of the system log files indicate
    a hacking attempt. <p>

<li><b>Violation log messages</b><br>
    A list of messages that indicate a potential security violation. Any message
    that is on this list but also in the 'Except for' list below it will be
    ignored. <p>

<li><b>Ignored log messages</b><br>
    Any log message listed in this field will always be ignored, even if it
    matches one of the hacking or violation message strings. <p>
</ul>

At the bottom of the page is a form for choosing exactly when Logcheck
should be run. However, if your Logcheck install uses a Cron script that
forces it to be run hourly or daily, this form will not be displayed. <p>
