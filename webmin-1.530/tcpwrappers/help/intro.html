<h3>Introduction</h3>
This module uses a simple access control language that is based on client (host name/address, user name), and server (process name, host name/address)
patterns.<p />
An extended version of the access control language is described in the hosts_options(5) document. The extensions are turned on at program build time by  building
with -DPROCESS_OPTIONS.
                            
<h3>Access Control Files</h3>
The access control software consults two files. The search stops at the first match:
<ul>                                                 
<li>Access will be granted when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.allow file.</li>
<li>Otherwise, access will be denied when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.deny file.</li>
<li>Otherwise, access will be granted.</li>
</ul>
A non-existing access control file is treated as if it were an empty file. Thus, access control can be turned off by providing no access control files.
