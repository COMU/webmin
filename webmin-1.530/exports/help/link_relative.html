<header>Make symbolic links relative?</header>

<i>This is a NFSv2-specific option.</i><br>
Converts absolute symbolic links seen by the client to relative links.<br>
For example, if the directory <tt>/usr</tt> was exported, a link from
<tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> to <tt>/usr/X11R6/bin</tt> would be converted to
<tt>../X11R6/bin</tt>. This makes a lot more sense if the client is
mounting the directory somewhere else than <tt>/usr</tt>.<br>
