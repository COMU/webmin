<header>Accept mail for users' real names?</header>

If this option is enabled, sendmail will accept email where the username part
is a user's real name rather than just their login name. For example, if the
user Joe Bloggs with login <tt>jbloggs</tt> existed on your system, you could
send mail to him at Joe.Bloggs@yourdomain.com as well as jbloggs@yourdomain.com .
