<header>Time before giving up</header>

When delivery of a message fails for some temporary reason (such as the
destination server being down), sendmail will keep the email in its queue
for the amount of time specified by this option, retrying delivery occasionally.
Once the time limit is reached, a bounce message will be sent back to the
sender and the message discarded. <p>
