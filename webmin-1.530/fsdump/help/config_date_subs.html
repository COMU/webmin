<header>Do strftime substitution of backup destinations?</header>

If this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, codes like %d, %m, %Y and %u can be used
in the backup destination filename. These will be replaced with the day, month
year and day of the week respectively when the backup is performed. This is
useful if you want to save a different backup every day, so that you can roll
a system back to a previous date. <p>

Some of the other codes that can be used are :<br>

 %a     The abbreviated weekday name according to the  cur<AD>
        rent locale.
