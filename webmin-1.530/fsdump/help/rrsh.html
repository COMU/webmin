<header>Remote restore command</header>

By default, the <tt>restore</tt> command will use the <tt>rsh</tt> command and
protocol to restore from other servers. However, this field can be used to select
a different command such as <tt>ssh</tt>, which is more secure and more
commonly used. SSH will only work if the <tt>root</tt> user's SSH configuration
allows passwordless logins from this system to the remote server. <p>
