<header>Path to rmt on remote system</header>

For the <tt>tar</tt> command to write a backup to a remote server, it
must invoke the <tt>rmt</tt> command on the destination system. This can
normally be left set to <b>Default</b>, but it the source and destination
servers run different operating systems you may need to set this to the
correct path to <tt>rmt</tt> on the destination. Common paths include
<tt>/etc/rmt</tt>, <tt>/usr/libexec/rmt</tt> and <tt>/usr/sbin/rmt</tt>. <p>
