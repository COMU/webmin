Fixed a bug that prevented the editing of quotas on loopback filesystems under Linux.
---- Changes since 1.150 ----
Quotas and usage are now displayed in bytes, kB, MB or GB where appropriate, instead of always kilobytes.
The quotaon -p command is now used to determine if quotas are active or not for some filesystem, which is faster and more reliable.

Email notification can be set up for users that are close to or have reached their soft or hard limit, on a per-filesystem basis.

Added Module Config option to display quota percentages, and mark those that are over some limit (thanks to Christophe Chisogne).
---- Changes since 1.210 ----

Added the ability to send email to managers of groups that are approaching or have exceeded their disk quotas.

On Linux systems, edquota is called with UIDs and GIDs instead of user and group names. This allows users with numeric usernames to be edited.
---- Changes since 1.310 ----
Added a Module Config option for sorting user and group quotas by the percentage of their hard limit in use.
---- Changes since 1.330 ----
On Linux systems with the setquota command, it is called instead of edquota to change user and group quotas.

---- Changes since 1.350 ----
Added a Module Config option to show both hard and/or soft quota percentages.

Quotas are considered active for a filesystem if the usrquota or grpquota options are on in /etc/mtab, even if missing from /etc/fstab.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----
If a user to email is a Virtualmin domain owner, send email to the domain's contact address.

Email to users and groups who are over quota on some filesystem can also be Cc'd to another address, such as the system administrator.
---- Changes since 1.440 ----
Converted all pages to use the new Webmin UI library, for a more consistent look. Also split the Filesystem Quotas page into tabs.
Converted commands in the module's API file to POD format, and added more details about each function.
