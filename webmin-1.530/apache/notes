notes about apache
------------------
Apache has a large number of directives which are valid in different 
parts of the config file (and maybe in other files such as .htaccess). The
available directives and their possible locations varies from release to
release of apache. Apache version from 1.1 to 1.3 will be supported.

Each type of directive is defined in some module, which may be compiled
into the server or not. Each module version supports some list of directives,
and the server version is basically a list of the modules/versions supported.

To implement this, each apache module will have one .pl file that has
functions for each directive, plus a master function that lists all the 
supported directives for this module version and their possible contexts.

The main apache config file is httpd.conf in the conf directory. This
file can refer to other files by some directives, or other config files
can be read as well.Directives can be in any config file (unlike NCSA).
This means that the config file must be read, parsed, and the other config
files read and parsed as well. Only then can the other directives be searched
for.
