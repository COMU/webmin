 - Cannot have different options for the same host on the same *local*
   filesystem. Ie

/usr -maproot=daemon florissa
/tmp -ro -mapall=jcameron:staff daemon florissa

Would not be allowed if /usr and /tmp are on the same local. But

/usr -maproot=daemon florissa
/tmp -ro -mapall=jcameron:staff daemon

Would be allowed because there is no local-filesystem/host overlap
