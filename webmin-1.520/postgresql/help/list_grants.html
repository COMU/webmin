<header>Granted Privileges</header>

This page allows you to view and edit the permissions granted on tables,
views, sequences and indexes to users and groups. The table shows all the
objects in all databases upon which privileges can be granted, and who
those privileges are currently granted to (if anyone). To change the
privileges, click on the name of the object and use the form to select
a user or group and the capabilities he will be given. <p>
