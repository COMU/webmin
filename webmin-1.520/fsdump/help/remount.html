<header>Remount with noatime option during backup?</header>

When this option is enabled, the filesystem being backed up will be remounted with the <tt>noatime</tt> option before the backup starts. This prevents the file reads done by the backup process from updating the last-accessed time of each file, and thus reduces disk activity. <p>

When the backup is complete, the original filesystem mount options will be restored. <p>
