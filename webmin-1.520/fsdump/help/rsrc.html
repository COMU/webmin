<header>Restore from file or device</header>

This option determines where the backup dump data is read from. It can either
be a local file or tape device, or a file or device on a remote host.
For restores from a remote host to work, it must support the
<tt>rmt</tt> protocol, which is not usually turned on by default for security
reasons. <p>
