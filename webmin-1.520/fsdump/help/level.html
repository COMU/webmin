<header>Dump level</header>

The dump level controls which files will be written to the backup. If level 0
is chosen, every file under the directory to backup will be saved. Otherwise,
only files that are new or modified since the last dump of a lower level will
be written. <p>

When backing up a directory that is not a filesystem mount point, the only
level that can be selected in 0. <p>
