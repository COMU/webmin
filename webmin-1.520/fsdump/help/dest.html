<header>Backup to</header>

This can either be the path to a file to which the backup will be written,
the path to a tape drive device (like <tt>/dev/st0</tt>), or a file or device
on a remote host. For backups to a remote host to work, it must support the
<tt>rsh</tt> protocol, which is not usually turned on by default for security
reasons. <p>
