<header>Remote backup command</header>

By default, the <tt>dump</tt> command will use the <tt>rsh</tt> command and
protocol to backup to other servers. However, this field can be used to select
a different command such as <tt>ssh</tt>, which is more secure and more
commonly used. SSH will only work if the <tt>root</tt> user's SSH configuration
allows passwordless logins from this system to the remote server. <p>

On Linux and BSD systems, you can also select the <tt>FTP</tt> option, which will
use Webmin's built-in FTP client program to transfer the backup to or from
the remote server. <p>
