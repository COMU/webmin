<header>Just add new files to archive?</header>

When this is set to <b>No</b> (as it is by default), the backup destination
will be replaced with an archive of all files currently in the source directories. But if you select <b>Yes</b>, only files that have been changed since the
archive was create will be appended to it. This is useful when making incremental backups. However, it cannot be used with compressed or remote archives. <p>
