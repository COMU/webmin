<header>Files to restore</header>

If this option is set, only the listed files will be restored from the backup.
The filenames must be relative to the filesystem that the backup was made from,
so if you backed up <tt>/home</tt> and wanted to just restore <tt>/home/foo</tt>
you would enter <tt>foo</tt> into this field. <p>
