<header>Backup is split across multiple files?</header>

If a backup has been made to multiple files using the <i>Split across multiple
files?</i> option on the backup page, you must select this option when restoring.
The filename to restore from will then have <tt>001</tt>, <tt>002</tt> and so
on appended to it to get the actual names of the backup files. <p>
