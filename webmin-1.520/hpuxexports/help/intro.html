<h3>HPUX NFS</h3>
This module allows you to configure directories (called <i>exports</i>
in HPUX) shared via NFS from your system. The first page
shows a list of directories and the clients they are exported to, allowing
you to click on the client to edit its options or start exporting
a new directory. <p>

Below the list of shares on the first page is a button which will
make the current configuration active. <p>

HPUX does not allow you to re-export a directory NFS mounted from
another server - only directories on filesystems can be exported. If
a shared directory contains the mount point of another local filesystem,
NFS clients of that share will not see files below that mount point.
The server must re-export each local filesystem separately, to be
mounted by clients at the correct point in the directory hierarchy. <p>
