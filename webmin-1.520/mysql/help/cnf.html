<header>MySQL Server Configuration</header>

This page can be used to adjust global configuration settings for the MySQL
database server. Typically you will not need to change any of these, although
the buffer and cache sizes can be increased on systems with large numbers of
tables and data. <p>

For any changes to take effect, the MySQL server must be stopped and re-started
using the buttons on the module's main page. <p>
