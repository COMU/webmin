<header>Edit Database</header>

At the top of this page are rows of icons, each representing one table in
the database. To edit the structure of a table, just click on one of the
icons. <p>

Below are buttons for creating a new table in this database, executing SQL
on the tables of the database and dropping the database and all tables in it.
The final button should be used with care, as it is not reversible! <p>
