<header>Database Permissions</header>

This page allows you to define which MySQL users will have access to
which databases from which hosts. Every user must already exist in the
<tt>User Permissions</tt> table, though they can be granted additional
permissions here. <p>

Users may not login from any hosts other than those specified in
<tt>User Permissions</tt>. However, you may grant different permissions
for different hosts by creating multiple rows for the same user. <p>
