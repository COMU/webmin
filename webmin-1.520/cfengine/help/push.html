<header>Remote Configuration Hosts</header>

This page lists other hosts on which CFengine is installed, so that you can trigger the processing of configured actions on multiple hosts simultaneously from one source. Each of the hosts must be running the Configuration Engine
daemon for remote processing to be activated. Note that the other hosts
will use their own local configuration, not the one from this server.
To distribute a master configuration to multiple hosts, have the configuration
copy itself when run using a <i>Copy files</i> action. <p>
