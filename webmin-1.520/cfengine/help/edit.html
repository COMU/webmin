<header>Edit Class</header>

This page allows you to set the details of an action for some class.
The first field on the page is always the 'Apply to class' input, which
allows you to choose which class or classes the settings below it apply
to. By default the class is Any, which means that the action will be
carried out every time the configuration engine is run. However if you
choose to enter something into the class field, the action may or may
not be run depending on the operating system type, hostname, current time
or other factors. <p>

The actual classes in effect are determined dynamically by CFengine at run
time. Useful ones are the system hostname with dots replace with underscores
(like <tt>foo_bar_com</tt>), the short hostname (like <tt>foo</tt>), the 
OS type (like <tt>linux</tt> or <tt>solaris</tt>), the current day of 
the week (like <tt>Monday</tt>), day of the month (like <tt>Day16</tt>), or
the month (like <tt>May</tt>). You can see the complete list of classes
available on your system by running CFengine in verbose mode. <p>

Multiple classes can be specified by separating them with | characters. So
to have your action run on both the hosts <tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt>, you
could enter <tt>foo|bar</tt> into the class field. <p>

The input fields below the class are dependant on the type of action being
edited. If the action type is not supported by Webmin, the actual configuration
file lines will be shown instead for manual editing. You can also switch to
manual mode by clicking on the <i>Edit Manually</i> button at the bottom
of the page. <p>
