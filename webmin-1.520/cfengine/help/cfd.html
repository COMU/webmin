<header>Configuration Engine Daemon</header>

The configuration engine daemon is a background process that serves several
purposes. It can execute the main configuration on a regular schedule,
it can accept requests from other hosts to execute the main configuration
immediately, and it can transfer files to other hosts that request a copy
from this server with a Copy Files action. <p>

The daemon has its own separate configuration file, with a similar structure
of actions and classes to the main configuration. If the configuration is
empty, you should start by creating a <i>Configuration daemon options</i>
action that defines commands run on schedule and when requested by other
hosts. Other action types can also be added to restrict access to copied files
to certain hosts. <p>

At the bottom of the page is a button to start the daemon (if it is not
currently running), or stop it (if it is running). <p>
