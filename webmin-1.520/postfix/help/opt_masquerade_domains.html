Address masquerading is a method to hide all hosts below a domain behind their
mail gateway, and to make it appear as if the mail comes from the gateway
itself, instead of from individual machines.

<p>

Address masquerading is disabled by default. To enable, specify one or more
domain names separated by whitespace or commas. For example: <tt>$mydomain</tt>
; in this example, addresses of the form <tt>user@host.$mydomain</tt> would be
rewritten to <tt>user@$mydomain</tt>.
