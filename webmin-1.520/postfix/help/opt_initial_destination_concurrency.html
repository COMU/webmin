<header>Initial concurrency level for delivery to the same destination</header>

<hr>

This parameter specifies the initial per-destination concurrency level for
parallel delivery to the same destination. This limit applies to delivery via
SMTP, via the local delivery agent and via the pipe mailer.

<p>

With concurrency of 1, one bad message is enough to block all mail
to a site. A concurrency of 2 seems a reasonable choice.
