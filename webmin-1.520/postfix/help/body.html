<header>Body Checks</header>

The optional header checks table allows email to be redirected based on the contents of the mesage body. Each entry in the table has a POSIX regular expression on the left-hand side, and an action on the right. <p>

The regular expression can be something like :<br>
<tt>/make.money.fast/</tt><br>
to match messages containing the text 'make money fast'. <p>

The action can be like :<br>
<tt>REJECT</tt><br>
to simply reject mail matching the expression, or :<br>
<tt>REDIRECT spam@yourdomain.com</tt><br>
To forward mail to another address. <p>
