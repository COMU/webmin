<header>Logging Options</header>

This page allows you to edit options that apply to the entire Syslog-NG
server, such as the handing of hostnames and the behaviour of DNS lookups.
It can also be used to change defaults that apply to all log destinations,
such as the owners and permissions on log files. These however can be overridden
on a per-destination basis. <p>
