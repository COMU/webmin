<header>User Grace Times</header>

Grace times are the amount of time a user may exceed his soft limit by
before being prevented from using any more disk space or creating any
more files. Once a user exceeds his soft block limit, he has the specified
amount of time to reduce his disk usage below the limit before he is
prevented from using more blocks. The same applies for the soft file limit.
