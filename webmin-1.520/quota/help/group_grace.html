<header>Group Grace Times</header>

Grace times are the amount of time a group may exceed its soft limit by
before being prevented from using any more disk space or creating any
more files. Once a group exceeds its soft block limit, it has the specified
amount of time to reduce its disk usage below the limit before it is
prevented from using more blocks. The same applies for the soft file limit.
