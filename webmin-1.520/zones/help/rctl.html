<header>Resource Control</header>

A resource control is a set of limits on the use of some resource within the zone,
and associated actions when they are exceeded. The available resources at the time
of writing are :
<dl>
<dt><b>zone.max-lwps</b>
<dd>Limits the number of processes that can be running within the zone at any one time.
<dt><b>zone.cpu-shares</b>
<dd>Sets a limit on the number of fair share scheduler (FSS) CPU shares for a zone.
</dl>

For each resource, you can enter a number of limits. Each limit has a privilege type
(which is always <b>Privileged</b>), a numeric limit, and an action to take when
the limit is exceeded. The typical action is <b>Deny</b>, to prevent any request
that would exceed the limit. <p>
