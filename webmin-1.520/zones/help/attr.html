<header>Generic Attribute</header>

An attribute is simply a named piece of database associated with a zone. Each attribute must have a unique name, a data type, and a value that is valid for that type. Attributes can be used to store comments, contact email addresses and other site specific information. They have no effect on the actual functionality of the zone. <p>
