<header>Package Directory</header>

A package directory is simply one that is shared between the global system and the zone via a loopback mount. Because processes running within a zone need access to system programs and files like those in <tt>/usr</tt> and <tt>/lib</tt>, these directories are almost always shared. This form can be used to define additional shared directories, such as <tt>/opt</tt>, for other programs that all zones need access to. <p>
