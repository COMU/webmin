This is the README file for the  OpenSLP webmin
module by Monty Charlton <monty@caldera.com>.

Installation is easy.

Just use the 'Webmin Modules' applet under 'Webmin Configuration'.
Use the '...' box to find openslp.tar.wbm and it should install fine.

Worst case, just copy the tar file to your webmin directory
(usually /usr/libexec/webmin) and extract it:
tar xvf openslp.tar.wbm

You may notice there are a number of config-some-system files in
the openslp directory.  You may have to edit the file that pertains
to your particular system.  If you do, please send me (monty@caldera.com)
the change you had to make to get things to work.

To make your module appear in the main list, you may have to edit
/etc/webmin/webmin.acl.  Just add openslp to the list somewhere and it
should magically appear.  But you probably won't have to do this.
