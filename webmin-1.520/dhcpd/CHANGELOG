---- Changes since 1.230 ----

The page listing leases now displays the number of IPs available for dynamic allocation, and the number assigned to clients.
Hosts with multiple fixed addresses have them all listed on the module's main page.

Added checboxes and buttons for deleting multiple subnets, shared networks, hosts and groups at once.
Fixed a bug that caused the display of large numbers of hosts and subnets to be slow.
Changed the Module Config PID file setting to allow None to be selected, which tells the module to look at the dhcpd process instead (as on OpenBSD).
---- Changes since 1.320 ----
Added a field on the Client Options page for the DHCP server identifier.

Fixed a bug that causes hosts to be deleted when searching for them!

Support the new configuration file format for custom options, as used in DHCPd version 3.

When a subnet or host is renamed, the user's ACL is updated to match.
---- Changes since 1.470 ----
Added a Module Config option to specify an alternate file to add new top-level objects (like subnets) to. This must be referenced by an include directive in the main dhcpd.conf though.
String custom options are now always quoted.
Converted buttons on the module's main page to use the Webmin UI library.
Expired leases are no longer counted towards usage on the DHCP Leases page.
Added a mode to the DHCP Leases page to show usage by subnet, thanks to a suggestion by Coles.
When applying the configuration fails with an error mentioning a line in the config file, 10 lines around that will also be displayed by Webmin in the error.
---- Changes since 1.510 ----
Added support for multi-value options, thanks to a patch from Luke Suchocki.
Also added support for multi-value options within a bracketed expression.
