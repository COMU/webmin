DHCPD ACL subsystem</h1></center>

<h3>
TARGETS:</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main goals of acl subsystem is providing a powerfull,
flexible and extendable mechanism for access control of different objects
in dhcpd configuration. This objects are shared networks, subnets, groups
of hosts and hosts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also acl subsystem allows you to control some other
features, such as: unique object names, applying of changed configuration,
viewing and deletion of dhcp leasures.
<h3>
CONCEPTS:</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhcpd configuration file we can show as a tree structure.
Each node of this tree represents a configuration of different dhcp objects
(fig. 0).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acl subsystem have 2 levels of permissions:
<ul>
<li>
global: read, write, create;</li>

<li>
per-object: read, write.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global permissions exists for every type of objects
(hosts, groups, subnets, shared networks) and controls operations with
a whole object set of given type.
<br>Global create
<br>Global read
<br>Global write
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per-object permissions give you a more flexible
way of access control. Per-object permissions acl exists for every object
individual object. Today only hosts and subnets per-object acls are impemented.
<br>Per-object read
<br>Per-object write
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acl subsystem can operate in 4 different security
levels (or modes).
