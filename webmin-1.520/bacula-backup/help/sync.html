<header>Bacula Group Synchronization</header>

Because the hosts in a Bacula group can be changed after they have been created
in this module, this page can be used to set up the automatic updating of
group membership information. This Webmin module caches the member hosts of
each group in the Bacula configuration, and so will not automatically detect
changes to membership unless synchronization is set up.<p>
