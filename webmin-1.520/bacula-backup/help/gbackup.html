<header>Run Bacula Group Job</header>

This form can be used to start the immediate execution of a Bacula backup
job that runs on all hosts in a Bacula group. To start it, just select it from
the list and click the <b>Backup Now</b> button. Because the job runs on 
multiple hosts, its final status will not be displayed. <p>
