<header>File Daemon Configuration</header>

This form can be used to adjust settings for the Bacula file daemon running
on the system. The defaults will typically be correct, although you can adjust
the daemon name and number of concurrent jobs. If your Bacula system supports
TLS security, the TLS options on this page can be used to secure communication
between the file daemon, director and storage daemons. <p>
