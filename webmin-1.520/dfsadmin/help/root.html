<header>Root Access</header>

Controls which hosts the server will respect the root user on. If a client
is not on the list, even if it can mount the share read-only or read-write
the NFS server will treat the root user on client as the
<a href=anon>Anonymous User</a>.

    <br>Hosts can be specified in the following ways :<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><b>Hostname or IP address</b> (like <i>ftp.foo.com</i> or <i>1.2.3.4</i>)
	<dd>Matches the host with the given name or address
	<dt><b>Netgroup</b> (like <i>engineering</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host that is a member of the netgroup
	<dt><b>DNS domain</b> (like <i>.foo.com</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host in the domain
	<dt><b>Network</b> (like <i>@10.254.1</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host in the network
	<dt><b>Network/netmask</b> (like <i>@10.254.1/24</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host in the network
	</dl><p>
    In addition, any of the above notations can be prefixed by a <i>-</i>,
    meaning that the host, netgroup, domain or network is <b>not</b> allowed
    to mount this share. This can be useful for allowing access by a set
    of hosts, but denying one member.
