<header>Read-Write Access</header>

This determines which hosts have read-write access to this share.
There are three choices for this option :
<ul>
<li><b>None</b><br>
    No hosts have read-write access.
<li><b>All hosts</b><br>
    Any host can mount this share read-write. If you are connected to the
    Internet, this means that anyone in the world can read, write and
    delete files in the exported directory. Use this option with caution.
<li><b>Listed hosts</b><br>
<if $gconfig{'os_version'} < 7>
    The hosts or IP addresses listed below can mount this share read-write.
<else>
    Matching hosts listed below can mount this share read-write. Hosts can
    be specified in the following ways :<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><b>Hostname or IP address</b> (like <i>ftp.foo.com</i> or <i>1.2.3.4</i>)
	<dd>Matches the host with the given name or address
	<dt><b>Netgroup</b> (like <i>engineering</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host that is a member of the netgroup
	<dt><b>DNS domain</b> (like <i>.foo.com</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host in the domain
	<dt><b>Network</b> (like <i>@10.254.1</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host in the network
	<dt><b>Network/netmask</b> (like <i>@10.254.1/24</i>)
	<dd>Matches any host in the network
	</dl><p>
    In addition, any of the above notations can be prefixed by a <i>-</i>,
    meaning that the host, netgroup, domain or network is <b>not</b> allowed
    to mount this share. This can be useful for allowing access by a set
    of hosts, but denying one member.
