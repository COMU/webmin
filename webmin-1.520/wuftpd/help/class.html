<header>Users and Classes</header>

The WU FTP server allows you to classify users based on the address they
login from and their user type. The three user types are :
<ul>
<li><b>Unix</b> - Normal users on your system.
<li><b>Guest</b> - Unix users who have been classified as guests.
<li><b>Anonymous</b> - Logins by the <tt>anonymous</tt> or <tt>ftp</tt> user,
		       if allowed on your system.
</ul><p>

The top section of this page allows you to define named classes, based
on user types and source addresses. Every login is classified into the
first matching class, so classes should be ordered from the most to least
specific. The matching addresses for each class can be full or partial
IP addresses, IP networks/netmasks, hostnames, host wildcards
(like <tt>*.foo.com</tt>) or the absolute paths to files containing additional
addresses. Any type of address can be preceded with a ! to negate it. <p>

The middle section of this page allows you to control which Unix users
to classify as guests. A guest user has similar rights to a normal Unix
user, but is restricted to a certain directory using <tt>chroot</tt>. <p>

The lower section of the page controls which Unix and guest users will
be denied access to the FTP server. You may specify users by name, by
GID (like <tt>%3000</tt>) or by GID range (like <tt>%3000-3010</tt>). <p>
