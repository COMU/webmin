<header>FTP Server</header>

This module allows you to configure the WU-FTPd FTP server installed on your
system. Users with accounts on your system can login to the FTP server and
access their files using client programs such as Netscape, <tt>ncftp</tt>,
the KDE file browser or one of the many Windows FTP clients. You can also
setup a public FTP server to which anonymous users are allowed read-only or
read-write access to a limited subset of files on your system. <p>

The main page of this module shows a table of icons, one for each category
of configurable options. If your FTP server is running as a standalone
process, a button will be displayed at the bottom of the page for you to
restart the FTP server and apply the current settings. However, if your
system runs FTPd from <tt>inetd</tt> as most do, any changes you make will
take effect immediately for new FTP sessions. <p>
