<header>Aliases and Paths</header>

The page allows you to create aliases that apply when the FTP client user
uses the <tt>cd</tt> command. The first table allows you to map <tt>cd</tt>
aliases to absolute directory paths. For example, if you created an alias
for <tt>foo</tt> for <tt>/usr/local/foo</tt>, then typing <tt>cd foo</tt>
into an FTP client would take the user to the directory <tt>/usr/local/foo</tt>.
<p>

The second text box is for enter directories to be searched when a 
relative <tt>cd</tt> is entered. For example, if directory <tt>/usr/local</tt>
was in the search path and the user entered <tt>cd bin</tt>, he would be
taken to <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> (assuming there was no directory called
<tt>bin</tt> in the current directory and no alias for <tt>bin</tt>). <p>
