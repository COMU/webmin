<header>Immediately sync all writes?</header>

When this option is enabled, all NFS writes by clients for this export will
be written to disk before success is reported back to the client. This is
slower, but ensures data integrity.<br>
When the option is disabled, writes by NFS clients may be buffered until later.<br>
<br><i>exportfs options: sync, async<br>
default: enabled (but disabled for releases of nfs-utils previous to 1.0.0)</i>
