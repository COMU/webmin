<header>Trust remote users</header>

Determines which Unix users on the client are trusted by the server.<br>
Three options are available :
<dl>
<dt><b>Everyone</b>
<dd>All client users will be treated the same by the server
<dt><b>Everyone except root</b>
<dd>The <tt>root</tt> user on the client is treated as the
    <a href="anonuid">untrusted user</a> by the server, but all other users
    are trusted.
<dt><b>Nobody</b>
<dd>All users on the client are treated as the <a href="anonuid">untrusted
    user</a>. This option is best used when exporting to a system that you
    do not control (such as a single-user PC), or when exporting to everyone.
