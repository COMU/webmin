<header>User Attributes</header>

This page can be used to assign profiles and authorizations to Unix users,
in order to grant them additional privileges. A profile defines a set of
authorizations granted to the user, and commands that the user can execute
with higher privileges (called execution profiles). <p>

In addition, this section can be used to create roles, which can also have
profiles and authorizations. Once a role is create, a user can inherit all
of the role's privileges, which makes it easy to grant the same access rights
to multiple users. <p>
