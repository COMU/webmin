<header>Profiles</header>

An execution profile is a mechanism used to bundle  together
the commands and authorizations needed to perform a specific
function. Each of the profiles listed on this page has a set of authorizations
and a list of sub-profiles whose authorizations it also inherits. <p>

You may want to add additional authorizations to your system if none
of those listed here provide the exact level of access control you need.
However, existing standard authorizations should be modified carefully, as
changing them may effect the privileges of systems users like <tt>root</tt>
and <tt>lp</tt>. <p>
