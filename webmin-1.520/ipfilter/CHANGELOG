---- Changes since 1.180 ----
First version of this module, which can manage an IPfilter firewall. Allows the creation, and editing of rules, and supports all actions and the most common conditions and options.
---- Changes since 1.200 ----
The firewall configuration can now be copied automatically to multiple hosts in a cluster, and will be applied on all hosts when the the Apply button is clicked. Like other cluster features in Webmin, this requires that the servers be first setup in the Webmin Servers Index module.
Added the ability to view and edit NAT rules, so that you can setup masquerading and port redirection.
---- Changes since 1.240 ----
On Solaris 10 systems IPfilter is now enabled at boot time using SMF, rather than an init script.
---- Changes since 1.340 ----
Added an option to match ports NOT within some range (and fixed the old option to match ports within a range).
