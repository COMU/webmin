<h3>Property Group Editor</h3>
The information displayed on this page corresponds to the list of
service property groups for both the service and selected instance.
Service-level property groups are displayed since their associated
properties are inherited by the instance unless they are overriden.
Clicking the property group name allows viewing/editing of individual
properties within the selected property group. Property groups can
also be added/deleted here. <p>
