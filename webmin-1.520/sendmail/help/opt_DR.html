<header>Forward unqualified usernames to host</header>

Unless <tt>Deliver locally</tt> is chosen, any mail sent by local users to
an unqualified username (like <tt>jcameron</tt>) will be forwarded to the
specified host. Useful if your system is a shared workstation and you want
all mail to go to a common mail server.
