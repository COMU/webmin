<header>Time before sending warning</header>

When delivery of a message fails for some temporary reason (such as
the destination server being down), sendmail will keep the email in its
queue, retrying delivery occasionally. Once this warning time limit has
been reached, a message will be sent back to the sender informing him of
the delay in delivering the message. <p>
