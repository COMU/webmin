ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives can now use the ! option to prevent proxying for some path.
---- Changes since 1.200 ----

When a virtual server in it's own private config file is deleted, the entire file will be removed to avoid leaving empty .conf files around.
---- Changes since 1.240 ----
Apache -D variables are now automatically detected on SuSE, Redhat and Mandrake systems, rather than needing to be entered manually.

---- Changes since 1.250 ----
Added a Module Config option for a directory to symlink new virtual host files from, to support the configuration system used by Debian Linux.
Added checkboxes and a button to the module's main page for deleting multiple virtual hosts at once.
---- Changes since 1.270 ----

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, replaced the existing pages for selecting Apache modules with one that that configures the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled directory, for much simpler and more workable control over modules.
---- Changes since 1.360 ----
Available Apache modules are now fully automatically detected on all operating systems, which does away with the Re-Configure Known Modules page.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----
Moved the SSL password option to the global settings level, to correspond with the way Apache expects it.
---- Changes since 1.410 ----
Added support for the funny ${APACHE_RUN_USER} and ${APACHE_PID_FILE} variables seen in apache2.conf on Ubuntu 8.04.
---- Changes since 1.430 ----
When a virtual host's base directory is changed, all <directory> blocks under it are updated too.
When stopping and re-starting Apache, give it time to fully stop before continuing.

Fixed handling of IPv6 addresses so that Apache's [address] format is now fully supported.
